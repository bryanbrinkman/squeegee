## Resolve the tool before the project

Inside the ABX source repository run `pnpm abx …`; elsewhere run the installed `abx`. A bare global
binary inside the repository may be older than the source. Start with:

```bash
abx version
abx doctor
abx capabilities --json
abx skill install
```

`abx doctor` reports binary provenance, CLI/skill drift, active chain, RPC health and history reach,
wallet readiness, canonical factories, storage, and configured remotes without exposing credentials.
Treat a red check as an actionable setup state, not as permission to improvise a workaround.

The shipped skill is named `abx`. `abx skill install` installs it to `.claude/skills/abx` and
`.agents/skills/abx` by default; `--agent`, `--global`, and `--target` narrow the destination. During
the rename transition the installer moves a recognized `abx-self-host` folder to
`.abx-skill-backups/` before installing the new name. It preserves custom bytes rather than deleting
them. For a custom skills parent, run `abx skill install --target <that-parent>`; do not move or merge
the old folder manually. Restart the agent after installation.

ABX requires Node 22.13 or newer. Prefer a project-local npm dependency for reproducible automation;
use a global install for interactive machine-wide use. Avoid repeated `npx` execution when version
provenance matters because caches can outlive an upgrade.

## Upgrade when a release is available

Treat an `update available` notice or an outdated `npm` row in `abx doctor` as a recommendation to
upgrade before planning a deployment or preparing a write. Do not silently change a global install
or a project's dependencies; tell the creator which version is installed, which version is
available, and give the command for that install:

```bash
# Global install
npm install -g @artblocks/abx-cli@latest

# Project-local install
npm install --save-dev @artblocks/abx-cli@latest
```

The latest ABX release retains support for canonical projects made with earlier releases unless a
specific contract generation is explicitly quarantined for a security or correctness reason.
Updating the CLI does not redeploy or mutate a project. New deployments may use newer factories or
defaults, so rerun help, capabilities, and the JSON dry run after upgrading.

Then refresh the copied skill in the same scope reported by the CLI, restart the agent, and check the
environment again:

```bash
abx skill install           # project copy
abx skill install --global  # global copy, when reported
abx doctor
```

If the creator defers the upgrade, say so once and continue only with the installed release's live
help and capability output. Never assume a newer flag or behavior exists in an older binary.

## Never expose secrets

Do not open, search, quote, or print `.env`. Do not echo variables to test whether they exist. Do not
paste a private key into a command line, generated file, wallet page, bug report, or transcript.

Sensitive values include:

- `ABX_DEPLOYER_PK` and any wallet key;
- credential-bearing `ABX_RPC_URLS*` values;
- `PINATA_JWT`, S3/R2 keys, `ABX_SERVICES_API_KEY`, other remote-provider tokens, effects/admin
  tokens;
- Arweave JWK contents and browser signing-session URLs.

Use `abx doctor`, `abx remote <name>`, `abx storage show --check`, and redacted CLI errors. If a tool
ever emits an unredacted credential-bearing endpoint, stop, rotate the credential, and report the
output bug without repeating the secret.

## Select the chain explicitly through the environment

Read the full `chains` array from `abx capabilities --json`. Do not rely on a remembered network
list. ABX is adding networks, and status may change between releases. There is no `--chain` flag
because ignoring a wrong-chain request could spend on the wrong network.

Choose a production chain by intended users, then measured cost. Use the `pairedChain` reported by
capabilities for the test run. Large onchain payloads cost more on every network, so compare the dry
run with Arweave, IPFS, or cloud custody.

Before any transaction on an `experimental` or `beta` network, name the network and support level,
explain what the transaction or transaction group will do, and state the relevant contract,
configuration, and real-funds risks. ABX has not had an independent third-party audit; bugs,
misconfiguration, and nondeterministic agent behavior may cause permanent loss. Link to the open
source, use-at-your-own-risk implementation at
https://github.com/ArtBlocks/abx. Qualify the same flow on the paired testnet before production.

Use per-chain RPC variables when operating more than one chain. `abx doctor` checks chain identity,
wide-range `eth_getLogs`, archival reach, and nonce coherence. Put a healthy archive endpoint first:
fallback transports rotate on errors, not on a successful but pruned empty log response.

The local projection and managed Arweave identity remain in `.abx-self-host/` unless
`ABX_DATA_DIR` overrides it. That runtime directory is separate from the renamed `abx` skill and is
not being renamed. Back up the managed Arweave key with `abx storage backup-key`; never print it.

Every WRITE command (`deploy*`, `add`, `index`, `mint`, `set-*`, …) resolves `.abx-self-host`
strictly relative to the current directory — it never searches upward, so it never creates a
project's state somewhere unexpected. A handful of READ commands (`status`, `state`, `verify`,
`doctor`, `capabilities`, `tokens`, `tokenuri`, `contracturi`, `inspect`, `minter show`) DO search
upward, git-style, for an already-existing `.abx-self-host` if the current directory doesn't have
one of its own — bounded at the home directory, a `.git` root, or the filesystem root. Practical
consequence: `cd`-ing into a project's `contracts/` subdirectory before `abx status` still finds
that project; the same `cd` before `abx add`/`abx deploy*` creates a NEW, empty node right there
instead. If a status/verify/etc. answer looks emptier than expected, or a write seems to have
landed in the wrong place, run bare `abx status` — its `data: <path>` line names the exact
directory that answered, including a note when it was found by searching upward — or set
`ABX_DATA_DIR` explicitly rather than guessing. See [Local data
directory](https://docs.abx.io/docs/using-abx/self-hosting#local-data-directory) for the full rule.

## Choose one signing lane

Every write uses one of four lanes:

| Lane | Select | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| Sponsored | `--sponsor` | The live remote advertises sponsorship for this chain and command |
| Hot | `--send` or default | An environment key may sign unattended |
| Wallet | `--sign --for 0x…` | A human approves in their browser wallet |
| Cold | `--unsigned --for 0x…` | A multisig/offline signer needs prepared transactions |

Honor an explicit creator choice. Otherwise run `abx capabilities --json`, the command help, and
`abx remote abx`. Prefer `--sponsor` when the provider advertises the active chain, the command and
transaction group are eligible, and sponsorship is enabled—especially on a testnet, where it removes
wallet and faucet setup. Sponsorship is provider policy, not protocol support: if it is unavailable,
paused, or ineligible, fall back to the appropriate bring-your-own lane rather than treating the ABX
operation as unsupported.

Select the lane before the JSON dry run. The signer can affect ownership, salts, and predicted
addresses. If the lane changes, rerun the dry run and summarize the revised plan before execution.

Run `abx doctor --for <address>` before a wallet or cold operation. On the wallet lane, give the
human the locally generated signing page; never request or handle their key. On the cold lane, verify
chain, sender, target, calldata, value, and ordering before handing transactions over.

`--onchain-image` staging cannot use the cold lane because each chunk transaction depends on the
receipt of the preceding transaction. Use hot, wallet, or sponsored signing. Do not split staging
into a homemade offline sequence.

`ABX_DEPLOYER_PK` may be written with or without a `0x` prefix — the CLI and SDK normalize it. Foundry's
`vm.envUint` does not: a custom forge script that reads the same `.env` needs the `0x` form.

For any one EOA, run one write command at a time. ABX obtains pending and latest nonces once, takes the
safe maximum, increments locally, waits for newly deployed code when a following transaction targets
it, and throws typed reversion errors. Starting concurrent processes bypasses that serialization.

## Prepare without mutating

Use command help and dry runs, not guessed syntax:

```bash
abx help deploy-code
abx deploy-code … --dry-run --json
```

A dry run may read contracts, probe endpoints, analyze files, or verify an address, but it does not
send or store. Address prediction is meaningful only when the salt and deployer are pinned. Use
`abx predict` when another contract or resolver must know the collection address before deployment.

Before any real send, confirm:

- active chain and deploying/owning address;
- contract family and edition arithmetic;
- name, symbol, royalties and royalty ceiling;
- deploy-time options such as burnability and creator-token enrollment;
- custody, public resolution, image/animation/trait surfaces;
- mint amount, value, transaction count, and expected gas;
- every irreversible lock or authority transfer.

Do not make a real send merely because a dry run exited successfully. The dry run is the plan; the
human confirmation authorizes execution.

## New environment checklist

1. Install Node 22.13+ and the desired CLI version.
2. Install the co-versioned skill with `abx skill install`, then restart the agent.
3. Select the testnet with `ABX_CHAIN` when the default is not appropriate.
4. Add RPC and storage configuration outside the transcript. If the live first-party remote
   advertises sponsorship for the chosen chain and command, recommend it before asking the creator
   to configure a signer. Otherwise configure one of the bring-your-own lanes. For first-party hosted
   services, run `abx auth login --no-open` in a short-yield or resumable session: immediately hand
   its verified browser URL and matching code to the human, then resume that same polling process.
   Let the CLI store `ABX_SERVICES_API_KEY` in ignored `.env` without printing it. The same Privy
   browser identity provisions or reuses the creator wallet; an existing browser session can avoid
   another email code. Never ask for an email code or key in chat, start duplicate login sessions,
   or add standing login instructions to `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`. The key is long-lived: reuse it
   across tasks and agent sessions. Run
   `abx auth keys` before creating a separate credential if the account is at its five-key limit;
   revoke an unused non-current key with `abx auth revoke-key <key-id>`. Run `abx auth logout` only
   for intentional teardown, compromise, rotation, or cleanup of the current key.
5. Run `abx doctor` and resolve every red check relevant to the chosen lane.
6. Run `abx storage show --check` when bytes will leave the local disk.
7. Run `abx remote <name>` before relying on a configured managed service.
8. Run command help, then a JSON dry run.
9. Confirm the plan and only then execute.

For an eligible first-party account, `--sponsor` replaces local key and faucet setup with an
account-bound creator wallet. The first use opens a Privy agent grant; later commands reuse that
grant for up to 30 days, unless the creator revokes it first. Do not ask for another browser approval when the
CLI resumes an existing grant. Use sponsorship only when the live descriptor and account
capabilities advertise the active chain. Test the exact flow on the reported paired testnet before
production. Read [services.md](services.md) before using it. Sponsorship is zero-value and never a
reason to skip the dry run or transaction summary.
